# Starbucks-Offers-Project
### Project Description
The dataset contains simulated data that mimics customers' behavior after they received Starbucks offers. The data is collected via Starbucks rewards mobile apps and the offers were sent out once every few days to the users of the mobile app.
Starbucks provided this dataset as an open-ended problem . I decided to investigate in the situation where customers used an offer without viewing it. I wanted to understand who are these customers and how we can avoid or minimize the chance of this from happening.


I built a machine learning model using RandomForest that can predict if a customers will not view but complete an offer or not, we can be giving offers with awearness and considerations. The model achived a 77% in accuracy score and 80% precision. I also used a confusion matrix. Further details are in my blog post.

I wrote a blog post to walk through the steps I took to achieve the result. the link of the post: https://medium.com/@khalid.albadr609/analyzing-starbucks-offers-cfd336e7035f

The data folder contains the 3 datasets.

The Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb is where all the analysis is.


Dependencies:
- Python 3.9
- Numpy and Pandas.
- matplotlib and seaborn.

Starbucks provided this dataset.
